## Info
I try my best to write the best code I can open source for people to use as reference (or steal 😡) for free!

If it doesn't meet my standards, I'll rewrite it!
Please, and I encourage you, open a commit request if you find a better implementation or have prettier looking code!

Please give me decent code references (ones with type checking)! Use my BibleAPI repository for expectations. 

I also do some Roblox game development, I'm able to support you the best I can!
